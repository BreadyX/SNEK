# snek
Snek is a simple snake clone running in a terminal. It was written just
for fun.

## Compilation

```sh
make
```
In a terminal (Linux and OSX) or compile it manually with:

```sh
gcc main.c graphics.c input.c -o snek
```

## Compatibility
The code *should* be cross platform. However it has not been tested.

Tested platforms:

- Linux
- Windows 10 1909

If you use OSX please try it and feel free to open a bug report for the problems 
you found.
